# Spain Emigration
What are the factors influencing the demographic movements inside Spain? [This visualization](https://jguinea.github.io/spain-emigration/spain.html) tries to answer this question, allowing the user to interact with a scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) linked to a map of Spain, and a bar chart that shows the inequality of some relevant factors between different areas.
