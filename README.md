# Spain Emigration
What are the factors influencing the demographic movements inside Spain? [This visualization](https://jguinea.github.io/spain-emigration/spain.html) tries to answer this question by allowing the user to interact with a scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) linked to a map of Spain, and a bar chart that shows the inequality of some relevant factors between different areas.

### Built with
* [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) - The visualization library.
* [GeoJson](https://github.com/geojson) - Map data structure.
* [SPLOM template](https://github.com/Louise777/BrushableScatterplotMatrix-d3) - Credit to Louise777 for bulding a D3v4 scatterplot matrix.
